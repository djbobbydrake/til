## Noisy Ouput from Pry

Using Pry as your rails console is great and it's on my todo list to dig into all the fanciness I have yet to discover.  However, anyone annoyed by all the outputs?  I don't need my query to actually print the long list of results all the time.  Turns out, you just need to add a semicolon `;`, and that suppresses the output.
